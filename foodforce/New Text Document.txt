This is what  believe should be the organization of the storyboard folders.

src (folder)
      storyboards (folder)
           Storyxyz (folder)
               storyboard.pkl (the storyboard.pkl file for that storyboard)
               data files (folder containing the data files regarding that story, data1.pkl, data2.pkl and so on)
               
               images (folder)
                    character images(folder containing images of the characters in the story)
                    chat images (folder containing other images to be shown with the chats)

(The indentation represents the hierarchy of the folder)

Also, once you are done with this, the next steps should be :

Create storyboard.pkl file and data.pkl files for the new storyboard. and collect images required for the chats, I guess we already have the required images for 
he characters.
Implement all the new features (if any) required for the new storyboard. I guess it would be great to have a window at the starting of the story to introduce 
the characters even.
Try and replace the old storyboard files with this new one and see if it is working properly.
Develop GUI to select storyboards from the given ones.

Do let me know if you have some issues/problems/doubts with any of the above tasks.
